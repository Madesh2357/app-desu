- Intelligent Cyclone Prediction: Analyze weather patterns using Fuzzy Logic with data from OpenWeatherAPI and Gemini API to predict cyclone probability. Gemini acts as a tool to cross-validate and refine the Fuzzy Logic algorithm's output, especially in edge cases or with limited data.
- Interactive Weather Map: Display current weather conditions and predicted cyclone probability on an interactive map using Google Maps API.
- Offline Weather Data: Offline data storage of 72-hour weather forecasts for access in areas with limited connectivity.
